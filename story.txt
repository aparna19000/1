Once upon a time there lived a monkey on a  jamoon tree near the baanks of the river. One day
a corocodile appeared in the front the monkey's eyes. He had travalled a long distance and was 
very hungry.

So the kind monkey gave him tasty jamoons to the tired corocodile. The corocodile ate the jamoons
and thanked the kind monkey. Soon they became close friends.
