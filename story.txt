Once upon a time there lived a monkey on a  jamoon tree near the baanks of the river. One day
a corocodile appeared in the front the monkey's eyes. He had travalled a long distance and was 
very hungry.

So the kind monkey gave him tasty jamoons to the tired corocodile. The corocodile ate the jamoons
and thanked the kind monkey. Soon they became close friends.

They enjoyed being together , played all day and ate sweet jamoons. One day the corocodile's wife 
came searching for him and found out that he is eating jamoons and is spending plenty of 
time with the monkey. She was jealous and very angry so she decided to kill the monkey.

Also the corocodile used to take some jamoons to his wife. One day she decided to trick the monkey
by inviting him for lunch, she convinced the corocodile too in her plan.
